The Bike Share Case Study
## 1. Introduction

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that offers inclusive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it accessible to people with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, about 8% use the assistive options. The program is popular for leisure rides, but around 30% of users also rely on it for daily commuting. Cyclistic aims to shift its marketing focus towards converting casual riders into annual members as they have proven to be more profitable. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the marketing team aims to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, determine why casual riders would consider a membership, and explore the impact of digital media on marketing strategies.

## 2. Scenario

As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, the director of marketing believes that the company's success hinges on maximizing annual memberships. Your team's objective is to gain an understanding of how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. With these insights, you will develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, your recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations in order to obtain approval from Cyclistic executives.

## 3. Data Analysis Process

In this case study, the six steps of the data analysis process will be used in order to solve this problem. Those 6 steps include:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

## The key questions

So here are the analysis questions that will help in the analysis:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. What are the causes that drive casual riders to buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media as a tool to convert casual riders to members?

## The Data given

**Data Source**:  Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 which is a public dataset published by Motivate International Inc. will be used to analyze and identify trends.

**Data Information**: In the data source, there are 12 files in total following the naming convention of *"YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata"*. Each file contains data for a specific month, including other details such as ride ID, bike type, start time, end time, start station, end station, start location, end location, and member status. The corresponding column names are:
- ride_id
- rideable_type
- started_at
- ended_at
- start_station_name
- start_station_id
- end_station_name
- end_station_id
- start_lat
- start_lng
- end_lat
- end_lng
- member_casual


## Processing the Data Using R

###Importing the Libraries

```
#load libraries 
library(tidyverse) #calculations
library(lubridate) #dates 
library(hms) #time
library(data.table) #exporting data frame
```

### Loading the data for 2021 monthwise

```
#load original .csv files, a years worth of data from August 2020 to July 2021
aug08_df <- read_csv("202108-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
sep09_df <- read_csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
oct10_df <- read_csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov11_df <- read_csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
dec12_df <- read_csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan01_df <- read_csv("202101-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
feb02_df <- read_csv("202102-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
mar03_df <- read_csv("202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr04_df <- read_csv("202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may05_df <- read_csv("202105-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
jun06_df <- read_csv("202106-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
jul07_df <- read_csv("202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

### Combining it into a single data file and creating a copy dataframe for operations

```
#merge all of the data frames into one year view
combined_df <- rbind (aug08_df, sep09_df, oct10_df, nov11_df, dec12_df, jan01_df, feb02_df, mar03_df, apr04_df, may05_df, jun06_df, jul07_df)

#remove individual month data frames to clear up space in the environment 
remove(aug08_df, sep09_df, oct10_df, nov11_df, dec12_df, jan01_df, feb02_df, mar03_df, apr04_df, may05_df, jun06_df, jul07_df)

combined_date <- combined_df 
```
### Calculating the ride time for each bike share ride
```
#calculate ride length by subtracting ended_at time from started_at time and converted it to minutes
combined_date$ride_length <- difftime(combined_df$ended_at, combined_df$started_at, units = "mins")
```
### Creating specific columns required for our analysis -
  Weekday
  Month
  Day
  Hour
  Time
  

```
#create columns for: day of week, month, day, year, time, hour
combined_date$date <- as.Date(combined_date$started_at) #default format is yyyy-mm-dd, use start date
combined_date$day_of_week <- wday(combined_date$started_at) #calculate the day of the week 
combined_date$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(combined_date$date), "%A") #create column for day of week
combined_date$month <- format(as.Date(combined_date$date), "%m")#create column for month
combined_date$day <- format(as.Date(combined_date$date), "%d") #create column for day
combined_date$year <- format(as.Date(combined_date$date), "%Y") #create column for year
combined_date$time <- format(as.Date(combined_date$date), "%H:%M:%S") #format time as HH:MM:SS
combined_date$time <- as_hms((combined_date$started_at)) #create new column for time
combined_date$hour <- hour(combined_date$time) #create new column for hour

```
### Creating the column for Seasons

```
#create column for different seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
combined_date <-combined_date %>% mutate(season = 
                                             case_when(month == "03" ~ "Spring",
                                                       month == "04" ~ "Spring",
                                                       month == "05" ~ "Spring",
                                                       month == "06"  ~ "Summer",
                                                       month == "07"  ~ "Summer",
                                                       month == "08"  ~ "Summer",
                                                       month == "09" ~ "Fall",
                                                       month == "10" ~ "Fall",
                                                       month == "11" ~ "Fall",
                                                       month == "12" ~ "Winter",
                                                       month == "01" ~ "Winter",
                                                       month == "02" ~ "Winter"))

```
### Creating the column for time of the day classification

```
#create column for different time_of_day: Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening
combined_date <-combined_date %>% mutate(time_of_day = 
                                             case_when(hour == "0" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "1" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "2" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "3" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "4" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "5" ~ "Night",
                                                       hour == "6" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "7" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "8" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "9" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "10" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "11" ~ "Morning",
                                                       hour == "12" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "13" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "14" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "15" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "16" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "17" ~ "Afternoon",
                                                       hour == "18" ~ "Evening",
                                                       hour == "19" ~ "Evening",
                                                       hour == "20" ~ "Evening",
                                                       hour == "21" ~ "Evening",
                                                       hour == "22" ~ "Evening",
                                                       hour == "23" ~ "Evening")
)

```
### Cleaning the Data: We follow the steps given below
  * To delete rows with null values
  * To remove ride data with ride length less than or equal to 0
  * To remove unwanted columns from analysis

```
#clean the data
combined_date <- na.omit(combined_date) #remove rows with NA values
combined_date <- distinct(combined_date) #remove duplicate rows 
combined_date <- combined_date[!(combined_date$ride_length <=0),] #remove where ride_length is 0 or negative
combined_date <- combined_date %>%  #remove columns not needed: ride_id, start_station_id, end_station_id, start_lat, start_long, end_lat, end_lng
  select(-c(start_station_id, end_station_id,start_lat,start_lng,end_lat,end_lng)) 

```
### We view the data and download it as a CSV for EDA and dashboarding

```
#view the final data
View(combined_date)

#download the new data as a .csv file
fwrite(combined_date,"bikeshare_data.csv")

```
