The Bike Share Case Study
## 1. Introduction

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that offers inclusive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it accessible to people with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, about 8% use the assistive options. The program is popular for leisure rides, but around 30% of users also rely on it for daily commuting. Cyclistic aims to shift its marketing focus towards converting casual riders into annual members as they have proven to be more profitable. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the marketing team aims to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, determine why casual riders would consider a membership, and explore the impact of digital media on marketing strategies.

## 2. Scenario

As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, the director of marketing believes that the company's success hinges on maximizing annual memberships. Your team's objective is to gain an understanding of how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. With these insights, you will develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, your recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations in order to obtain approval from Cyclistic executives.
